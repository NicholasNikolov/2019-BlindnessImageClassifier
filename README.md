# Blindness-Classifier
An Image-classification sample project for detecting diabetic retinopathy.

The source data for this competition comes from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection

The code presented is a simple implementation of Keras convolutional neural networks for classifying the images and determining severity of retinopathy. The model output is a probability for each class and the maximum probability is taken to be the predicted severity classification.
